# Smart Car V2.0 
The project is based on the working of a car on its own with dectecting the obsticals and we can even control it by our phone as well. The initial Project was made by wrenze youtube channel was just a basic remote controlled car that is controlled by the arduino car app. The updated version of the project has a added ultrasonic sensor and updated the code to a self controlling mode. The another change was made on the movement of the tire, so for the base project they used two tires for taking turns but we made it to four tires. if an obstical comes in front of the it, the car takes a reverse then a turn and then goes straight. we had to use "Arduino Bluetooth control" app fot the update.
