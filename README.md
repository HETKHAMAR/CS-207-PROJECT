# Smart Car V2.0 
The project is based on the working of a car on its own with dectecting the obsticals and we can even control it by our phone as well. The initial Project was made by wrenze youtube channel was just a basic remote controlled car that is controlled by the arduino car app. The updated version of the project has a added ultrasonic sensor and updated the code to a self controlling mode. The another change was made on the movement of the tire, so for the base project they used two tires for taking turns but we made it to four tires. if an obstical comes in front of the it, the car takes a reverse then a turn and then goes straight. we had to use "Arduino Bluetooth control" app fot the update.

# Repository Contents

This repository contains the Following content:- 
* /Base code - The code given by the refrence. 
* /Bluetooth control code - So this is the code for First mode(Smartphone controlled)
* /libraries - their is a new library used that is new ping library(for second mode ultrasonic car).
* /LICENSE - The license file. 
* /README.md - A short summury of this repository.

# Requirements and Materials 
The following new librariy was used by this project:

* NewPing_v1.9.1 : This library is used to get access to the ultrasonic sensor

Materials Used :
  * 1x Bread board 
  * Jumper wires 
  * 1x Ultrasonic Sensor 
  * 1x Servo motor
  * 2x panels of battries 
  * 1x motor driver 
  * 1x Arduino Uno
  * 4x DC motors 
  * 4x tires 
  * 1x HC- 05 Bluetooth module 
  
  # Design and Schematics
  This is a 3D design for this project. It is also included in images folder.
  we will have two of each because for obstical avoiding car we have different circuit and different one for bluetooth car.
  This One is for Ultrasonic One

  # Usage 
  This project can be a future to more and more inovative toys. the ultrasonic sensor is a really a very sensitive sensor and can be used in modification to different gadgets.
